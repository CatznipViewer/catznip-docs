# Clean Install The Viewer

!!! warning "Do NOT attempt to follow these instructions while the viewer is running!"

A clean install is a manual procedure that removes the viewer, all cache, configuration files and replaces it with a completely fresh install. If you are doing this as part of a viewer update, then we recommend you follow ALL of the steps in order.
