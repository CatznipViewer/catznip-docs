Catznip R10 is a long overdue update that brings the viewer right up to date with all the latest from Linden Lab and fixes several issues from R9.

A huge thank you to everyone who has stuck with us since the last release (20 months previous!), as those close to the project will know it has been a long and difficult time with altogether too many health issues. Things are finally heading back in the right direction :)

At this time we only have a Windows release, Linux will follow shortly.

Due to a lack of time and suitable hardware we are unable to build, test and debug an OS X version to the standard our users would expect from Catznip. At this point it seems unlikely that there will be future OS X versions of the viewer. Thanks to those who have offered remote access or to build the viewer on our behalf.
