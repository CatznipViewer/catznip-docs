Catznip R5 is a little overdue and initially started out as a maintenance release, but you know how these things go, poke this , poke that, add something here, ranting screaming fit there …

Very proud to present Catznip Script Recovery. Ever crash or get logged out while editing a script and then loose all your work?

Following a crash or forced disconnect you’re now presented with a dialog offering to recover the scripts you had open.

This works for all scripts, everywhere, and as we found out while trying to take the screenshot for this release, is very robust and persistent. It wont go away till you either recover or dismiss it .. even if you crash.

Ongoing, this pushes some more of of the work done with chat. There is now a right click context menu that allows you to switch between a single and re-sizable multi-line chat bar on the fly as well as making it easy to globally change the chat font size, the spell checker also got a lot of attention in perpetration for submission to the official client. There is a lot more to come in this area and feedback is greatly appreciated.

Group moderators get a bonus this release, you can now eject a user by opening the participants list and using the right click context menu. No more opening the group floater, waiting, searching for the user name, waiting, waiting. Just, click, click, bye bye jerkface.

RLVa got a well needed service with a number of FUI and location based bugs getting squished, SharedWear was also enabled by default. You no longer need to bother with folders naming attachment points for things you place in an #RLV Folder, it just works. On related note, this release also includes the Lab’s fix for RenderResolutionDivisor, so things that make your vision fuzzy now function as they should.

Fans of a more classic interface and anyone with limited screen real estate will love the new Mini Location Bar and ability to remove the Buy L$ and Marketplace buttons. Just right click the top status bar.

## Highlights
* Script Recovery : Never loose a script you were working on because the viewer crashed or you got logged out. works with all scripts, everywhere. Open scripts are auto-saved locally every 60 seconds. In event of viewer crash, scripts are presented to the user and optionally recovered to lost & found folder.
* Chat Enhancements : A big push with some our chat overhaul features.
* Eject from Group : Option on the group participant context menu to eject someone from a group, remove unwanted members without needing to open the group floater and search.

## Status Bar
Cleaned up and tightened top status bar, especially useful if you prefer a minimalistic UI or just run the viewer with limited screen real estate (like on Kitty’s fancy ION netbook. Funny ..

## RLVa & SharedWear
Aside from some pretty major FUI related bug fixes to [[RLVa]], the big change here is [[SharedWear]] being on by default. [[SharedWear]] means that items placed inside a [[♯RLV Folder|#RLV Folder]] do not need to be placed in attachment point named folders.
