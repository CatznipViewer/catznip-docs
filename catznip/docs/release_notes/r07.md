# Catznip R7

<sup>(Imported from MediaWiki - layout may be broken)</sup>

![Catznip_R7.jpg](Catznip_R7.jpg)

Wow! Ok, this release has been a massive undertaking that went on far longer than it should have. We got off to a slow start thanks to some RL and then bogged down as a number of our internal projects matured to the point of release. We always plan to add new things in odd numbered releases and the bug fix and polish the even numbered ones but might have gotten a bit carried away this time.

There is so much new in this release it's difficult to know where to start. But will mentioning the brand new wiki, it's a work in progress as there is a lot to document fully and that is going to take time, so rather then hold things up further we're going to show and tell what we can and worry about that later.

We added a new view to the Appearance Tools and buttons for layer ordering, our own Build Tools with a unique eye dropper tool, copy paste and axis manipulation, separate Chat Alerts for both local and IM/groups. Detach Folder lets you remove groups of worn objects with a single click, Font Selection allowing for different UI & Chat fonts (also the awesome Open Dyslexic Font[1]) and Group chat got some more love with bold names and better sorting with the new ability to 'Snooze' rather than just close and end the session.

The Mini Map was made awesome. Really.

We added the legacy places search to both the main search floater and to the smaller places floater for quick and easy access.

On the User Interface side, Inventory gets a lot of attention with a new custom tab and fixed copy & paste. The people floater got a total overhaul as well as a massive amount of reworking.

I've probably missed out a ton of new things (like the awesome derender, the ability to right click on mesh attachments and a mess of RLVa bugfixes).

Read the full Release Notes and Download.

## Appearance Tools
Appearence floater has been over hauled with a new 'Inventory View' display option for the wearing panel and quick up/down icons to reorder items worn on the same layer. '''Find Original''' has been added tot he context menus and opens an Inventory floater. 

![Catznip_R7-2](Catznip_R7-2.jpg)

* added   : up/down (re)ordering arrows shown for wearable types with more than one worn wearable
* added   : "Appearance" sort order to the wearing panel which sorts items in (more or less) order of appearance on the avatar
* added   : "Sort by" menu on the "Wearing" panel's gear menu to control the item's sort order
* added   : "Find Original", "Properties" and "Detach Folder" options on the list item context menu
* added   : ability to switch between a list view and inventory view of currently worn items
* changed : new toolbars for the outfist list and wearing tabs

* fixed   : the currently worn outfit folder isn't selected when opening the appearance sidepanel floater
* fixed   : "Inventory List Refresh" decimates FPS after opening the "Edit Appearance" item list panel
** with this change the frame rate will still be impacted, but only when the list control is currently visible

## Build Tools
Limited new build tools added including unique pipette pickers, parameter copy and paste, edit object at root, adjustable object axis and ability to rez objects under the land group even across parcel boundaries.

This is a long way from what we have in mind for the build tools so should be seen as a stop gap to make Catznip competative with other TPV's extended controls.

![Catznip_R7-4](Catznip_R7-4.jpg)

* added  : 'Axis at Root' checkbox on the build floater to position the axis on the center of the first (root) object in the selection rather than the center of the bounding box of the entire selection
* added  : axis options floater to control the "AxisPosition" and "AxisOffset" settings
* added  : copy/paste buttons to the build floater for position, size, rotation and prim parameters
* added  : pipette pickers for the texture and color on the build tools texture tab
* added  : 'Refresh' button to the build tools' 'Contents' panel
* added  : "RezUnderLandGroup" setting to rez prims under the land group rather than the avatar's active group
	* rezzing a prim across parcel borders will rez it with the proper parcel's group
* changed : uncommented the "Restore to Last Position" option in the inventory context menu
	* added two (ignorable) notifications: one for copyable and one for non-copyable objects to prevent accidental usage

## Chat Alerts

* added : apply different highlighting masks on chat, IM and group/conference chat messages

## User Interface Reworking
