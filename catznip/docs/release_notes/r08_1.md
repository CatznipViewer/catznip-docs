# Catznip R8.1

<sup>(Imported from MediaWiki - layout may be broken)</sup>

We were hoping that R8 would have everything you needed for Linden Lab's roll out of Server-side Appearance (SSA), and it would have, if LL hadn't decided there would be one more round of changes the day after we released. Talk about worse timing ever!

Catznip R8.1 is essentially R8 with the very latest SSA changes, a few crash fixes and tweak or two for good measure.

**This is a mandatory update and is now the very minimum version of Catznip that is supported.** We can not stress this enough, do NOT use anything older than R8.1 ever ever again. even if it snows, even if it snows fire.

## Fixes
* fixed : crash in LLVOVolume::lineSegmentIntersect() when right-clicking mesh
* fixed : crash in LLDirIterator::Impl::next()
* fixed : crash in LLVolatileAPRPool::clearVolatileAPRPool() - failed assertion
* fixed : creating a new group opens one group floater per joined group

## Improvements
* added : "CrashSubmitLog" debug setting to (optionally) send the last 16Kb of the session log along with a crash report
* changed : flipped the defaults on some debug settings
	* 'RezUnderLandGroup' to enabled
	* 'MiniMapObjects' to disabled
	* 'CacheSize' to 1024 (default cache size of 1Gb)
	* 'PluginUseReadThread' to enabled
	* 'ShowAdvancedGraphicsSettings' to enabled
	* 'NameTagShowFriends' to enabled
