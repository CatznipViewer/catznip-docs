This is the maintenance release we were trying for last time and is strongly recommended, kitty did try and sneak in a few new features while she bashed away at the bugs but I stopped her! Not having any of that nonsense I said .. bad kitty.

That all said a brand new floater to send group messages appeared out of nowhere, just right click on a group in ‘My Groups’ and away you go. Incoming group messages got some love and are now just a bit more readable and they sort correctly, oh, and we jammed in a ton of windlight presets from a variety of sources (sorted and cleaned them up too).

Of the numerous bugs ironed out in this release, the delay when you right click something, or when you want to edit has been blasted to tiny pieces, as has the rather nasty one involving our spell-checker and multi-line chat (sorry about that). Thanks to everyone who contributed on the Issue Tracker and passed on feedback.
