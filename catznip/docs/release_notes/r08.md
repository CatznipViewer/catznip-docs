# Catznip R8

![Catznip_R8](./r08/Catznip_R8.jpg)

This release brings initial support from Linden Lab (LL) for server side appearance (SSA, formerly known as SSB, I know, right..), Havok integration adds the long awaited ability to upload mesh objects and the full set of pathfinding features. We've added a couple more little usability features that we know you'll love and some minor updates to RLVa.

We've been holding back on this release wanting to make sure we provided a good experience with SSA when it goes live, LL are working up to the wire and we didn't feel entirely comfortable with the state of the project. As it stands this release provides only initial support for SSA, There will be more from LL and that will be in Catznip R9.

All in all this delay has really paid dividends; we've been able to polish up the 'R7 feature flood' and worked in a lot of crash and bug fixes, including a few last minute ones that came up in our beta testing. Will be looking to expand the beta test team for the next release, but as always, quality over quantity.

Personally, this feels like one of the most polished releases we have ever done and it certainly flies.
