# @setcam_unlock

Force the camera to remain focused on the user's avatar at all times, in effect, making them the fixed centre of the world. Formerly RLV command @camunlock.

!!! tip "@setcam_unlock=&lt;n|y&gt;"

Possibly change: currently still allows free camera movement when controlled through by LSL.
