## @startim

Prevents starting / opening a new IM conversation with another user.

!!! tip "@startim=&lt;n|y&gt;"

* IM conversations already open when this command is applied will remain open.
* Incoming Teleport offers and inventory will function but not open a new IM window.
* Messages attached to teleport offers/requests sent from the user will be censored.

Attempts to start a IM session will present the user with "Second Life: Unable to start IM session with &lt;target_user&gt; due to RLV restrictions"
