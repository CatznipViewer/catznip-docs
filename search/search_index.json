As a project, Catznip is not and will never be a bucket list of features plucked from the other projects or pre-release Linden code. It\u2019s about taking a fresh look at things and attempting to do them better. RLVa Catznip is the development viewer for RLVa written by Kitty Barnett. This is an extended reimplementation of the RestrainedLove API created by Marine Kelley. RLVa has been in circulation since mid 2009 and is independent, sharing no code with RLV. (See RLVa / RLV Differences). RLVa goes from Catznip into many other viewers making it especially useful for script developers as it represents the future of RLVa often months ahead of the mainstream. Entirely Home Grown Unless explicitly stated, Catznip does not borrow code from other TPV projects, it is, simply put, an original work built upon the code released by Linden Lab. We will always explicitly give credit for external code where it is due, for the rest, the Catznip Team did it. We go to great lengths to ensure the published Catznip source code is readable, identifiable, and easy to be separate from the main on a patch by patch basis.

More importantly, any personal information shared will be used solely for what it was provided for: i.e. if you enter your/an email address to make a comment, or start an issue on the bug tracker, then that is used solely as a requirement of the website in question and not something we will specifically look at. Similarly if you opt-in to include your avatar name with a crash report it\u2019s used only in the context of looking at why you crashed (i.e. to contact you for more information). Website Non-personally-identifying information made available by your browser (such as browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each request) is \u2013 like it is for most websites \u2013 stored in a log on the hosting server, along with potentially personally-identifying information such as your IP address. The retention period for each day\u2019s worth of visits is 7 days, after which it is automatically deleted. Information in those logs will only be used for anonymous aggregated statistics: i.e. the number of visitors in a given day or month, or the number of downloads of a specific release.

Additionally, no personally-identifying information (i.e. avatar name or username ) is sent back to the site at all. Crash Reports Special attention has been given to ensure that Catznip crash reports contain only as much information as they need to (which is significantly less than is included by default in other viewers). This makes our life easier as we aren't digging through mountains of data we have no use for and further protects your privacy. A submitted crash report is retained only for as long as is needed: once it has been looked over there is no further need for it and it will be permanently deleted. General information about a crash log may be shared with Linden Lab (i.e. in the form of a P- JIRA if for instance notice that a significant number of people are all experiencing the same crash but can\u2019t fix it), the crash report itself will be treated as strictly personal and will not be shared. Required Information This is the bare minimum information we need to identify and diagnose your crash. If we can't tell what was going on, we can't possibly hope to fix it. Non personally identifying information such as which operating system you're using, video card and amount of memory. A minidump; a binary file that will allows us to see where in the code you crashed, containing minimal variable information from the crash.

There is the possibility that this data may include your computer user name, the Second Life usernames of people you interact with, or the nature of interactions (inventory offers, etc). The scope of this information will change from version to version depending on what is being debugged at the time. We strive to keep the submitted data to the minimum required. Changes to this policy This privacy policy might change from time to time: any significant changes will be explained specifically (a significant change would be a change in intent, or a change in what is collected or how it is used, etc) even if it\u2019s only to point out that it is has changed.

How to use You can restore an object to it's last known region coordinates from inventory by right clicking and selecting Restore to Last Position. This can be useful to place objects back after they have been accidentally returned to inventory. You must have rez permissions at <0,0,0> on the region as objects will appear in world at that location and then be moved. INVENTORY LOSS WARNING If you do not have permission to rez at <0,0,0> on the current region , attempting to use this feature WILL result in no-copy objects being lost forever. Historical Context When the Zindra continent was announced many residents pointed out that it would be a lot of work and hassle (to sheer impossible) to pick up their (adult) build from its then-current location and move it to the new adult continent. LL 's response was \"Restore to World\" which was released in the official viewer and then removed again shortly after due to some shortcomings. Notes for Region Owners Restore to last position is region independent by design. An object rezzed at a specific location on one region can be restored to that position on a different one.

Historically, the #RLV Folder has suffered a technical limitation. The viewer simply did not know where objects were to be attached. As a work around you have always been required to place objects in attachment point named sub folders. Historically RLVa would attempt to simplify this process by making the folders automatically the first time an item was worn. A work around the work around so to speak. SharedWear is an RLVa feature that corrects the original problem. You simply no longer need attachment point named folders cluttering up your #RLV folder or item names. Any existing attachment point references will still be honored so nothing breaks. RLVa doesn\u2019t automatically make attachment point folders as they are no longer required.","title":"Shared Wear"},{"location":"features/shared_wear/#shared-wear","text":"SharedWear represents one of the most obvious end user differences between RLVa and RLV and is enabled by default in all current RLVa Viewers.

R for release and then a number incrementally higher then the previous (I kid you not). So anyway, to celebrate we have not one but two releases side by side. Essentially cleaning up the 3.2.0 Beta we released recently, adding couple of new features and a slew of fixes. R3 and R4 are functionally identical in all regards with the exception that R4 includes the first round of OpenGL fixes from Linden Lab. R3 is provided as a fall back for those who have problems. R4 should be noticeably faster. The Group floater now has a drop down menu allowing you to quickly select your active title for the current group, including the option to have a group active with no title displayed. Almost all floating panels can now be \u2018rolled up\u2019 to just show the title bar, nice quick way to clean up the window clutter. Simple, but very effective.

Ok, this release has been a massive undertaking that went on far longer than it should have. We got off to a slow start thanks to some RL and then bogged down as a number of our internal projects matured to the point of release. We always plan to add new things in odd numbered releases and the bug fix and polish the even numbered ones but might have gotten a bit carried away this time. There is so much new in this release it's difficult to know where to start. But will mentioning the brand new wiki, it's a work in progress as there is a lot to document fully and that is going to take time, so rather then hold things up further we're going to show and tell what we can and worry about that later. We added a new view to the Appearance Tools and buttons for layer ordering, our own Build Tools with a unique eye dropper tool, copy paste and axis manipulation, separate Chat Alerts for both local and IM /groups. Detach Folder lets you remove groups of worn objects with a single click, Font Selection allowing for different UI & Chat fonts (also the awesome Open Dyslexic Font) and Group chat got some more love with bold names and better sorting with the new ability to 'Snooze' rather than just close and end the session. The Mini Map was made awesome. Really. We added the legacy places search to both the main search floater and to the smaller places floater for quick and easy access. On the User Interface side, Inventory gets a lot of attention with a new custom tab and fixed copy & paste. The people floater got a total overhaul as well as a massive amount of reworking. I've probably missed out a ton of new things (like the awesome derender, the ability to right click on mesh attachments and a mess of RLVa bugfixes). Read the full Release Notes and Download. Appearance Tools Appearance floater has been over hauled with a new 'Inventory View' display option for the wearing panel and quick up/down icons to reorder items worn on the same layer. '''Find Original''' has been added tot he context menus and opens an Inventory floater. added : up/down (re)ordering arrows shown for wearable types with more than one worn wearable added : \"Appearance\" sort order to the wearing panel which sorts items in (more or less) order of appearance on the avatar added : \"Sort by\" menu on the \"Wearing\" panel's gear menu to control the item's sort order added : \"Find Original\", \"Properties\" and \"Detach Folder\" options on the list item context menu added : ability to switch between a list view and inventory view of currently worn items changed : new toolbars for the outfit list and wearing tabs changed : show attachment point names for worn attachments in the wearing appearance panel fixed : the currently worn outfit folder isn't selected when opening the appearance sidepanel floater fixed : \"Inventory List Refresh\" decimates FPS after opening the \"Edit Appearance\" item list panel (with this change the frame rate will still be impacted, but only when the list control is currently visible).

Ok, this release has been a massive undertaking that went on far longer than it should have. We got off to a slow start thanks to some RL and then bogged down as a number of our internal projects matured to the point of release. We always plan to add new things in odd numbered releases and the bug fix and polish the even numbered ones but might have gotten a bit carried away this time. There is so much new in this release it's difficult to know where to start. But will mentioning the brand new wiki, it's a work in progress as there is a lot to document fully and that is going to take time, so rather then hold things up further we're going to show and tell what we can and worry about that later. We added a new view to the Appearance Tools and buttons for layer ordering, our own Build Tools with a unique eye dropper tool, copy paste and axis manipulation, separate Chat Alerts for both local and IM /groups. Detach Folder lets you remove groups of worn objects with a single click, Font Selection allowing for different UI & Chat fonts (also the awesome Open Dyslexic Font) and Group chat got some more love with bold names and better sorting with the new ability to 'Snooze' rather than just close and end the session. The Mini Map was made awesome. Really. We added the legacy places search to both the main search floater and to the smaller places floater for quick and easy access. On the User Interface side, Inventory gets a lot of attention with a new custom tab and fixed copy & paste. The people floater got a total overhaul as well as a massive amount of reworking. I've probably missed out a ton of new things (like the awesome derender, the ability to right click on mesh attachments and a mess of RLVa bugfixes).

The main new feature in R9.0 is the Chat which has been rebuilt from scratch. LL added CHUI , we spent a huge amount of time trying to make it nice only to find the performance with it enabled was unacceptable. As the old chat was removed at the same time we had no choice but to start over. Chat has been redesigned from scratch and includes many CHUI inspired features. Inventory searching has been made lightning fast, textures now have a preview tool-tip, script editor got a lot of love with a tighter UI , as you type highlighting for text searches, more work was done overhauling the UI and a new in place updater was added. From Linden Lab this release adds CHUI (even though we don't expose it), facebook support, fitted mesh , materials, ribbon particles and request teleports amongst others things. In answer to huge gap between R8 and this release we shelved a lot of things we were working on and started our open beta program. A huge thank you to everyone who got involved, reported bugs and issues, helped find bugs and crashes, made suggestions. This has been so successful that it will form the basis of all releases going forward. Future releases will be smaller and incremental with more public testing. We hope this will allow up to keep up with Linden Lab, continue to deliver unique new features and make Catznip the most stable Second Life viewer. There is a small mountain of work we did that just isn't polished enough to get in this time, expect to see a new things coming through thick and fast as we go forward.

The main new feature in R9.0 is the Chat which has been rebuilt from scratch. LL added CHUI , we spent a huge amount of time trying to make it nice only to find the performance with it enabled was unacceptable. As the old chat was removed at the same time we had no choice but to start over. Chat has been redesigned from scratch and includes many CHUI inspired features. Inventory searching has been made lightning fast, textures now have a preview tool-tip, script editor got a lot of love with a tighter UI , as you type highlighting for text searches, more work was done overhauling the UI and a new in place updater was added. From Linden Lab this release adds CHUI (even though we don't expose it), facebook support, fitted mesh , materials, ribbon particles and request teleports amongst others things. In answer to huge gap between R8 and this release we shelved a lot of things we were working on and started our open beta program. A huge thank you to everyone who got involved, reported bugs and issues, helped find bugs and crashes, made suggestions. This has been so successful that it will form the basis of all releases going forward. Future releases will be smaller and incremental with more public testing. We hope this will allow up to keep up with Linden Lab, continue to deliver unique new features and make Catznip the most stable Second Life viewer. There is a small mountain of work we did that just isn't polished enough to get in this time, expect to see a new things coming through thick and fast as we go forward.","title":"Catznip

I\u2019ve written about this before (see http://blog.catznip.com/2017/03/catznip-r12-three-days-of-teasers-day-1.html ) so I won\u2019t go into minute detail but essentially this feature attempts to keep your inventory more manageable and organized by letting you decide where a folder should go at the time you receive it. Imagine going to a shopping event; some of the things you\u2019ll want to buy on the spot, while others you\u2019ll want to grab a demo of. Maybe you try it on the spot, or maybe you\u2019ll accumulate all the demos and then teleport home to try things on at your own leisure. Most likely you\u2019ll end up with a bunch of new top level folders cluttering up your inventory and some new things in your Objects folder. And if you sort that then and there anything you bought will end up hopelessly lost. With this feature, you\u2019ll now get a new drop-down when you get offered a folder (or on the buy floater as well) letting you decide where something should be saved to so for me personally, anything I buy I put into my \u201cShopping Bag\u201d folder, and any demos I want to try I divert to my \u201cDemos Only\u201d folder. Clicking the browse of the wrench icon will let you simply pick a folder, or provide you with more advanced configuration options: This means that if \u2013 for instance \u2013 I go to this month\u2019s Uber event and buy something it\u2019ll be auto-sorted to a special \u201cShopping / 2017-December / Uber\u201d folder and even if I don\u2019t unpack or touch a single box I\u2019ll still have some semblance of a sorted inventory. (You can get to the \u201cAccept in\u201d configuration floater from the Inventory / Gear menu and \u201cConfigure Accept In\u201d) Accept in (Object folder) As useful as the above is, it soon became apparent that boxed up items or demos still presented a problem: I like to demo things at my own house but if the demo is boxed up that means that the demo object is in the events folder (since I acquired it there), but the unboxed folder will be in a folder for my home region since that\u2019s where I unpacked it. Clearly there needed to be some way to keep the contents of an unpacked object near to where that object itself lives in your inventory and this new feature was born: for the most part (and if I did everything correctly) you shouldn\u2019t even notice this too much and things will just work as you\u2019d expected them to. For instance: If the accept in destination is prefixed with the word \u201cObject:\u201d it simply means that I\u2019m trying to be clever and offering to let you unpack an object into the same folder the item lives in rather than some completely unrelated folder elsewhere in your inventory. Since there are as many inventory organizing schemes as there are residents, this might >not< be the behavior you want in which case you can click the little wrench icon and untick the following: Searching The next big inventory feature is the completely revamped inventory filter floater which comes in both an expanded (tall) version on the left, or the more compact (tabbed) version on the right. Simply click the arrows in the bottom right to switch between one and the other. The biggest change here \u2013 and one that I end up using all the time now \u2013 is searching your inventory for a keyword. You\u2019ll notice that at the top it says \u201cExact\u201d, \u201cAll\u201d and \u201cAny\u201d: Exact \u2013 search your inventory as you always have; an item needs to contain exactly what you type in order to show in the filtered list All (new) \u2013 splits what you type in words; in order to be visible an item needs to contain all of the words that you typed but not necessarily in that order Any (new) \u2013 again we\u2019re searching by words but any item that contains at least one of the words you type will be show in the filter Examples: I remembered picking up some Wasabi Pills hair 2-3 months ago and picking the Ombre pack so combining \u201combre\u201d >and< \u201cWasabi\u201d (so an \u201cAll\u201d search) instantly gave me what I needed ! I needed to find a gacha kitty headband I got months ago. Good luck! So I searched my inventory for all occurrences of \u201cband\u201d, \u201chead\u201d >or< \u201chair\u201d (so an \u201cAny\u201d search) and after a lot of scrolling I got it Play around with these a little bit and you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re extremely useful tools to let you find that specific item you\u2019re looking for that would have otherwise been much harder to locate. Once you\u2019re familiar with the \u201cExact\u201d, \u201cAll\u201d and \u201cAny\u201d concept pay attention to the shorthand code that\u2019s appearing in the main inventory floater as well. You don\u2019t need to actually specify a search type on the filter floater, you can simply prefix your regular search words with \u201cany:\u201d and \u201call:\u201d as well. Finally, since it was a special request it\u2019s also possible to search your inventory using regular expressions (don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know what this means!): Show Contents In Often you'll be searching for something and either only the folder containing the items shows up, or only one of the items shows up. In that case, you can either right-click the item and go \"Open in window\", or cancel the current search and find the folder back but both of those are clunky and feel annoying. With this feature you'll be able to right-click the folder and pick \"Show Contents In / Current Search\" which will make all the items in that folder visible regardless of whether they match the current search words or not. Mark as protected/system folders If you right-click one of your own folders you\u2019ll have a new option to treat it as if It was a system folder : this means that it sorts at the top with the other system folders if you have \u201cSort System Folders to Top\u201d checked and it will also prevent you from accidentally deleting it. This doesn\u2019t actually mess with your inventory but is rather a local setting; if you use multiple computers then you\u2019ll have to do it for each once (I\u2019m working on that!), and it won\u2019t apply to any other viewers. Folder context menu enhancements As you might be able to spot from the screenshot above I did some minor layout changes to the inventory context menu; with the new inventory options and LL \u2019s new \u201cUse as default\u201d it felt like the menu was getting rather bloated; so in order to keep it manageable I decided to fold all inventory creation options into the \u201cNew Items\u201d sub menu. If you have any thoughts to share (good or bad) please do use the feedback option in the viewer; for things like this the only way I know whether a change worked out for the best or not is if you all tell me \ud83d\ude0a. Take (Replace Links) Firestorm added a convenient \u201cReplace Links\u201d feature which was then contributed back to Linden Lab and is present in R12 as well (you can read more about this on LL \u2019s blog or Inara\u2019s blog posts). As an extra convenience I added a \u201cTake (Replace Links)\u201d option to the context menu of a rezzed object which will take the item into inventory and pre-fill the replace links floater. (Note that the option will only show if the rezzed object has links pointing to it in your inventory) Quick preferences Main Catznip\u2019s version of \u201cquick preferences\u201d was added in R11; R12 adds some minor functionality and enables the mysterious \u201cquick inventory\u201d tab. Minor improvements: CATZ-278 - The 'Quick Preferences' floater should be collapsible CATZ-293 - Add \"Quick Preferences\" to the main (Me) menu The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl-Shift-P (the conflicting shortcut of 'Print Selected Object Info' was changed to Alt-Shift-P) Remember and restore the last active quick preferences tab Added a button for avatar rendering exceptions to the \"Quick Preferences\" floater Added a sorting menu to the wearing quick preferences tab Bug fixes: CATZ-295 - 'Render Attached Lights' check box on the quick preferences panel doesn't turn off lights immediately Quick inventory We all keep several HUDs attached in order to get to them quickly if we need to (i.e. mesh body/head HUD , or a hugger/dance/posing HUD ) or worse, things we only need ever so often and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll hate hunting them down in inventory because it feels clumsy and interrupt getting dressed. The quick inventory panel is my first attempt at a way to define things you want to have quick access to: First you create a folder anywhere in your inventory, named anything you like (you might even already have such a folder at the ready) and fill it with links (or copies) to items you frequently need or, as you can tell from my example, you can put links to any existing outfits you might have.

Chat Group snoozing \u201cGroup snoozing\u201d first appeared in Catznip 5 years ago (and has since been picked up by Firestorm and other TPVs) but it was only ever available through the group chiclet \u2019s context menu so it wasn\u2019t very discoverable (or configurable aside from the debug setting). R12 adds a per-group option to always snooze group chat when you hit the little x to close group chat, and a way to configure that specific group\u2019s snooze time-out; the \u201cnext occurrence\u201d option simply closes the group chat session until the next time someone says something (whether it\u2019s 5 seconds after you close it, or 5 hours) which can be useful if you run a support group for instance. To configure, go to Communicate / Groups \u2013 right-click the group you wish the change the option for and pick \u201cView Info\u201d. The option will be 2/3rd of the way down: Additionally if you already have group chat open, you can always right-click the group\u2019s chiclet and pick \u201cGroup Info\u201d from there to get to the groups properties/profile floater or to snooze the group chat (using the default set). Finally, you\u2019re also able to manually snooze group chat using the new chat toolbar icon; if you configured closing group chat to always snooze then you can for instance pick \u201cUntil relog\u201d to not see group chat until you relog (or until manually reopen it). Only join conferences started by friends There\u2019s recently been some griefing that involves joining busy groups only to then start mass-conferences with group members; this option will only accept conference conversations that were started by someone on your friends list. If a conference is blocked you\u2019ll briefly see a toast and a message will be logged to nearby chat. Additionally, I also provided an option to auto-ignore all group voice calls (note that this doesn\u2019t block voice conferences from friends or non-friends). Chat History LL added the chat history a couple of years back but it \u2013 at least to me \u2013 never ended up feeling like it could replace hunting for the log folder and then opening the chat log in Notepad to search for what I wanted. In R12 it got a bit of a polish and three new functionalities were added to hopefully start making it more usable/friendly: The drop down allows you to filter the chat history down to a specific year (or month) The search box will search through the chat history for the specified word/sentence. Note that when you open the chat history it opens the last page by default so if you search for something you\u2019ll need to click the back button to search back in time. The text file icon will, when clicked, open the chat log in your standard text editor (e.g. Notepad) The following bugs relating to the chat history were also fixed: Viewing the chat history of someone who isn't in conversations.log opens an empty history when legacy names are enabled The \"chat history\" floater always starts on page 0 The \"chat history\" floater doesn't remember its last position and/or size CATZ-341 - Disabling \"UseLegacyIMLogNames\" doesn't use the same chat log names as the LL viewer CATZ-360 - Added missing \u201cchat history\u201d button to the nearby chat toolbar Magnifying glass on avatar profile picture(s) When you hover over a profile texture on the (legacy) profile floater, About Land, a group\u2019s profile, \u2026 your cursor will show the zoom option which will open a texture preview floater of that texture (note that you do not have permission to save it to disk) with a fixed aspect ratio that matches the texture control\u2019s. Notifications filtering In R11 the notifications floater was revamped; in R12 there\u2019s a new option for those of us who keep old notifications around but still want an easy way to see which notifications (group notices) are new. The \u201cSince Logoff\u201d option will (similarly to your inventory\u2019s Recent tab) show only those notifications that were added since your last logoff (and any from the current logon session). Additionally, every month the Luxe Box group is filled with people who don\u2019t know how to get to a group\u2019s notices so as a reminder there are 4 additional ways to easily get to the group notices in Catznip (does not apply to other viewers): From a group notice by clicking the group name (requested by a user and added in R12) The envelope icon in the group chat tool bar The \u201cGroup Notices\u201d option in the group chat\u2019s chiclet right-click menu The \u201cView Notices\u201d option in the right-click menu of the People / Groups tab Additionally you\u2019ll be able to instantly open the group\u2019s profile by right-click the group\u2019s name in the group notice, as well as the notice\u2019s sender. Related bugfixes: CATZ-324 - Notification close/delete button moves to the right when closing many notifications in a row CATZ-355 - Group notifications in the notifications floater are shown in GMT Building Texture flip Another long-time request since LL took this away; clicking the button will flip the horizontal/vertical scale (for diffuse, normal or specular depending on your current edit mode). Hex/HTML color value support I was trying something with complementary colors and got annoyed that I had to keep converting from hex color value to RGB so there you go \ud83d\ude0a. Region restart floater shaking This was a long time request, sorry it took so long to get around to it but it\u2019s finally here \ud83d\ude0a. Related bugfixes: CATZ-296 - Region restart shows the wrong remaining time Region restart floater is missing its green/red background Increased texture memory With the move to 64-bit it\u2019s finally possible to increase the viewer\u2019s texture memory allowance; since it seems LL has already been working on this I\u2019ve only done a minimal change. Since I don\u2019t have access to a wide variety of video cards it\u2019s possible you still may not be able to change it beyond the old 512Mb limit. Finally, keep in mind that your video card\u2019s memory is shared between all currently running programs (i.e. browser tabs), so even though your card might have 2Gb or more of RAM the slider is conservatively capped at 1/3rd of total. Change it in Me / Preferences \u2013 Graphics tab and Advanced Graphics (a revamp of the graphics preferences is coming! I know the default is horrid \u2639). For those on the Windows 10 Fall Creator update you\u2019ll have a very easy way to monitor your GPU memory usage by using the Task Manager: (Note that the texture memory slider has been excluded from graphics presets \u2013 see CATZ-351 ) Mouse walking This has also been an on/off popular requested feature since it's apparently a big deal in WoW, and the standard way you move around that world. I\u2019d really appreciate feedback on whether I got it right or wrong or if you have any suggestions for change. The following 2 changes were made: *When you hold down both the left and right mouse button on your own avatar you'll start walking forward for as long as at least both buttons are held down (so in order to stop walking you need to release at least one button). While you're walking you can move the mouse around to steer; this hasn't changed and was always the behavior when the left mouse button was down on yourself (or your own name tag). If you keep only the left mouse down then the camera will rotate along with your avatar ; if you keep only the right button down then the camera will rotate around your avatar which will keep facing the same way (it\u2019ll make more sense when you try it \ud83d\ude0a). Click your avatar (or name tag) with both mouse buttons to start moving forward. Move the mouse to steer. Release both buttons to stop, or release one to allow camming (see below). When you let go of the right mouse button and keep holding down the left button you can orbit the camera and your avatar will turn to face the same direction. When you let go of the left mouse button and keep holding down the right button your camera will orbit but your avatar will keep facing the same way. Pressing both buttons once more will move you forward once more. Note that you can switch between walking and running using the \u201cAlways Run\u201d toggle [Ctrl-R]. In WoW holding down the left mouse will orbit the camera around your character without changing its orientation while right-click holding will orbit and rotate your character as well. In Second Life the left-hold-orbit has already always rotated your avatar around so I didn't want to touch that, secondly context menus are always supposed to open right after the mouse goes down so instead I had to use the middle mouse button to allow you to orbit around without actually turning that way. (Note that by default the middle mouse button is bound to \u201cTalk\u201d for voice chat \u2013 if that hasn\u2019t been changed this feature is disabled) While the middle mouse button is down the left and right mouse buttons will act as modifier keys: Middle mouse down: same as holding down the Alt key Left + middle mouse: same as holding down the Ctrl+Alt camera modifier Middle + right mouse: same as holding down the Ctrl+Alt+Shift camera modifier Try it out and provide feedback as needed \ud83d\ude0a. Avatar rendering exceptions When you right-click someone you (see screenshot) you have the option to always render that avatar regardless of your avatar complexity settings (or never render them) but that preference didn\u2019t persist and was lost on every relog. R12 incorporates the avatar rendering list in the blocked/mute list floater (see screenshot) which you can get to from the normal places as well as the quick preferences appearance panel. Note that the avatar rendering exception list is stored locally and per-viewer (requests to change this need to go through LL \u2019s JIRA unfortunately, it requires a minor server change to how the mute list is stored). RLVa No new functionality but the following bugs were fixed: CATZ-301 - Typing animation still starts when @redirectchat restricted CATZ-311 - @stopim doesn't end the IM session when @startim restricted CATZ-317 - Texture tooltips should be blocked when @viewtexture=n restricted CATZ-319 - Texture preview still available when @viewtexture=n CATZ-332 - Crash saving a texture to disk while @viewtextures=n restricted CATZ-350 - Can't force ground sit while avatar is moving Chat animation isn't properly adjusted when @chatwhisper/normal/shout restricted @camdist[min|max] and @camunlock aren't enforced when using a scripted camera Various minor improvements CATZ-297 - Add Strawberry Singh's 'Light Up My SLife' and 'Headshots' Windlight sky presets CATZ-312 - Add an item for the Recent tab to the 'Communicate' menu CATZ-373 - Add Block / Unblock to the agent SLURL context menu (right-click their name in chat/ IM /groups) Various other bugfixes CATZ-277 - Teleports no longer log to nearby chat CATZ-281 - Double-clicking the group list scrollbar starts a group chat session CATZ-287 - Place inspector no longer appears on the world map CATZ-289 - Eject / Ban options are missing on the group chat context menu CATZ-292 - (Re)set \"reapply current Windlight settings at logon\u201d as the default CATZ-303 - Group moderators not sorted to the top of the list in group chat CATZ-304 - Double-clicking names in the group chat list does nothing CATZ-306 - Hotspot to drag and drop attachments to notices is misplaced CATZ-313 - Closing the 'Replace links' floater crashes the viewer if a replace is in progress CATZ-337 - ' UI Size' can't easily be reset to 1.0 CATZ-364 - Render quality in the 'About' floater appears to be zero-based CRASH-4 - Crash when closing a chat conference through the IM well floater (or right-clicking the IM well button / Close All) 'DeleteItems' notification can\u2019t be permanently ignored Can't eject a member in a group role from the participant context menu Clicking between the world and the inventory floater freezes the viewer Show eject/ban confirmation request and enable the context menu option for both single and multiple selections Crash when opening the wearing panel right after switching outfits Crash when opening the legacy profile floater with no avatar Incoming IMs and nearby chat messages freeze the viewer Searching a text editor backwards breaks when mSelectionEnd < mSelectionStart Show the appropriate folder icon for folder links in inventory list controls New website + backend Last, but certainly not least there's also been a lot of work done on a new Catznip website, as well as completely redoing the way the updater and crash reporter work. We'll be slowly unveiling this over the course of the year but for now you there's at least the new download page @ https://get.catznip.com !","title":"Catznip R12"},{"location":"release_notes/r12/#catznip-r12","text":"","title":"Catznip R12"},{"location":"release_notes/r12/#inventory","text":"","title":"Inventory"},{"location":"release_notes/r12/#accept-in","text":"This is definitely one of the most important features of this releases and one that (I hope) will have the most impact on how you deal with shopping in Second Life and keeping your inventory manageable. I\u2019ve written about this before (see http://blog.catznip.com/2017/03/catznip-r12-three-days-of-teasers-day-1.html ) so I won\u2019t go into minute detail but essentially this feature attempts to keep your inventory more manageable and organized by letting you decide where a folder should go at the time you receive it. Imagine going to a shopping event; some of the things you\u2019ll want to buy on the spot, while others you\u2019ll want to grab a demo of. Maybe you try it on the spot, or maybe you\u2019ll accumulate all the demos and then teleport home to try things on at your own leisure. Most likely you\u2019ll end up with a bunch of new top level folders cluttering up your inventory and some new things in your Objects folder. And if you sort that then and there anything you bought will end up hopelessly lost. With this feature, you\u2019ll now get a new drop-down when you get offered a folder (or on the buy floater as well) letting you decide where something should be saved to so for me personally, anything I buy I put into my \u201cShopping Bag\u201d folder, and any demos I want to try I divert to my \u201cDemos Only\u201d folder. Clicking the browse of the wrench icon will let you simply pick a folder, or provide you with more advanced configuration options: This means that if \u2013 for instance \u2013 I go to this month\u2019s Uber event and buy something it\u2019ll be auto-sorted to a special \u201cShopping / 2017-December / Uber\u201d folder and even if I don\u2019t unpack or touch a single box I\u2019ll still have some semblance of a sorted inventory. (You can get to the \u201cAccept in\u201d configuration floater from the Inventory / Gear menu and \u201cConfigure Accept In\u201d)","title":"Accept in"},{"location":"release_notes/r12/#accept-in-object-folder","text":"As useful as the above is, it soon became apparent that boxed up items or demos still presented a problem: I like to demo things at my own house but if the demo is boxed up that means that the demo object is in the events folder (since I acquired it there), but the unboxed folder will be in a folder for my home region since that\u2019s where I unpacked it. Clearly there needed to be some way to keep the contents of an unpacked object near to where that object itself lives in your inventory and this new feature was born: for the most part (and if I did everything correctly) you shouldn\u2019t even notice this too much and things will just work as you\u2019d expected them to. For instance: If the accept in destination is prefixed with the word \u201cObject:\u201d it simply means that I\u2019m trying to be clever and offering to let you unpack an object into the same folder the item lives in rather than some completely unrelated folder elsewhere in your inventory. Since there are as many inventory organizing schemes as there are residents, this might >not< be the behavior you want in which case you can click the little wrench icon and untick the following:","title":"Accept in (Object folder)"},{"location":"release_notes/r12/#searching","text":"The next big inventory feature is the completely revamped inventory filter floater which comes in both an expanded (tall) version on the left, or the more compact (tabbed) version on the right.

The biggest change here \u2013 and one that I end up using all the time now \u2013 is searching your inventory for a keyword. You\u2019ll notice that at the top it says \u201cExact\u201d, \u201cAll\u201d and \u201cAny\u201d: Exact \u2013 search your inventory as you always have; an item needs to contain exactly what you type in order to show in the filtered list All (new) \u2013 splits what you type in words; in order to be visible an item needs to contain all of the words that you typed but not necessarily in that order Any (new) \u2013 again we\u2019re searching by words but any item that contains at least one of the words you type will be show in the filter Examples: I remembered picking up some Wasabi Pills hair 2-3 months ago and picking the Ombre pack so combining \u201combre\u201d >and< \u201cWasabi\u201d (so an \u201cAll\u201d search) instantly gave me what I needed ! I needed to find a gacha kitty headband I got months ago. Good luck! So I searched my inventory for all occurrences of \u201cband\u201d, \u201chead\u201d >or< \u201chair\u201d (so an \u201cAny\u201d search) and after a lot of scrolling I got it Play around with these a little bit and you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re extremely useful tools to let you find that specific item you\u2019re looking for that would have otherwise been much harder to locate. Once you\u2019re familiar with the \u201cExact\u201d, \u201cAll\u201d and \u201cAny\u201d concept pay attention to the shorthand code that\u2019s appearing in the main inventory floater as well. You don\u2019t need to actually specify a search type on the filter floater, you can simply prefix your regular search words with \u201cany:\u201d and \u201call:\u201d as well.

Change it in Me / Preferences \u2013 Graphics tab and Advanced Graphics (a revamp of the graphics preferences is coming! I know the default is horrid \u2639). For those on the Windows 10 Fall Creator update you\u2019ll have a very easy way to monitor your GPU memory usage by using the Task Manager: (Note that the texture memory slider has been excluded from graphics presets \u2013 see CATZ-351 )","title":"Increased texture memory"},{"location":"release_notes/r12/#mouse-walking","text":"This has also been an on/off popular requested feature since it's apparently a big deal in WoW, and the standard way you move around that world. I\u2019d really appreciate feedback on whether I got it right or wrong or if you have any suggestions for change. The following 2 changes were made: *When you hold down both the left and right mouse button on your own avatar you'll start walking forward for as long as at least both buttons are held down (so in order to stop walking you need to release at least one button). While you're walking you can move the mouse around to steer; this hasn't changed and was always the behavior when the left mouse button was down on yourself (or your own name tag). If you keep only the left mouse down then the camera will rotate along with your avatar ; if you keep only the right button down then the camera will rotate around your avatar which will keep facing the same way (it\u2019ll make more sense when you try it \ud83d\ude0a). Click your avatar (or name tag) with both mouse buttons to start moving forward. Move the mouse to steer. Release both buttons to stop, or release one to allow camming (see below). When you let go of the right mouse button and keep holding down the left button you can orbit the camera and your avatar will turn to face the same direction. When you let go of the left mouse button and keep holding down the right button your camera will orbit but your avatar will keep facing the same way. Pressing both buttons once more will move you forward once more. Note that you can switch between walking and running using the \u201cAlways Run\u201d toggle [Ctrl-R]. In WoW holding down the left mouse will orbit the camera around your character without changing its orientation while right-click holding will orbit and rotate your character as well. In Second Life the left-hold-orbit has already always rotated your avatar around so I didn't want to touch that, secondly context menus are always supposed to open right after the mouse goes down so instead I had to use the middle mouse button to allow you to orbit around without actually turning that way. (Note that by default the middle mouse button is bound to \u201cTalk\u201d for voice chat \u2013 if that hasn\u2019t been changed this feature is disabled) While the middle mouse button is down the left and right mouse buttons will act as modifier keys: Middle mouse down: same as holding down the Alt key Left + middle mouse: same as holding down the Ctrl+Alt camera modifier Middle + right mouse: same as holding down the Ctrl+Alt+Shift camera modifier Try it out and provide feedback as needed \ud83d\ude0a.","title":"Mouse walking"},{"location":"release_notes/r12/#avatar-rendering-exceptions","text":"When you right-click someone you (see screenshot) you have the option to always render that avatar regardless of your avatar complexity settings (or never render them) but that preference didn\u2019t persist and was lost on every relog.

The same is true for features added by Linden Lab. Animesh in particular had a very negative impact on performance which we have largely negated with some extra work (including a fix from Beq for rendering rigged attachments with shadows enabled). Actual performance improvements often depend on your specific computer: all being well, performance should be at least that of R12. If your computer is CPU bound and has GPU to spare then you should see an improvement. If you don\u2019t currently have shadows enabled because it was a little too slow to have enabled all the time, try enabling them with the new release, for some the change is enough to allow \u201cshadows by default\u201d. Given the wide variety of hardware and settings out there, we would really appreciate to hear your feedback. Especially if it\u2019s worse; or worse under specific circumstances; and of course if you noticed an improvement we\u2019d love to hear from you as well. Render Others As One popular suggestion was to add an option to only render friends in order to improve frame rate for busy (shopping/music) events. In Catznip tradition I ran with the suggestion and gave it a Catznip twist so now we have an extra \u201cRender\u201d option on the quick preferences panel. Before explaining the new options in-depth I\u2019d like to make sure everyone is on the same page with how the complexity settings works so let\u2019s start with a quick recap: The complexity slider determines the maximum complexity that avatars around you can have: if their avatar cost is higher they\u2019ll be rendered as a jelly doll (coloured imposter). The # Non-impostors slider determines how many nearby people that are under your complexity limit will be rendered in full, while everyone else will be shown as an imposter (a jelly doll that isn\u2019t a uniform colour but rather still has all the textures of the actual avatar ). Catznip then added an easy way for you to select that friends should always be rendered in full, regardless of your other settings, and additionally everyone standing near you (within chat range) as well as individual exceptions. The new options are (from bottom to top): Everyone normally \u2013 the default: with this selected people will show as they always have (and subject to the settings) Everyone as imposters \u2013 this basically overrides your \u201c# Non-impostors\u201d slider and shows those around you as an imposter (except the people that fall under your exceptions). This will provide a noticeable FPS boost, and is best combined with leaving \u201cNearby avatars\u201d unchecked Everyone as silhouettes \u2013 this takes the setting above one step further and shows everyone as an untextured outline. This setting will work best with \u201cNearby avatars\u201d unchecked. Recommend this is enabled before teleporting to a busy event as this will prevent all avatar related textures from being downloaded, loading the vendors faster and saving texture memory by not downloading textures for silhouetted avatars. Example: Myself and exceptions \u2013 \u201chide\u201d everyone around you except for those specified by exceptions. You can add specific avatars as an exception so you can see people who aren\u2019t on your friends list. Only myself \u2013 Finally, if nothing else works (or if you\u2019re just trying to take a picture and people keep running into view!) this option will render you and only you. If none of the above made much sense then don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s really easy so just play with the option and give it a try and you\u2019ll find what works best for you easily. During testing we found that we would often forget that we turned off the rest of the world! As long as a non-default setting is active the following appears on the bottom of your screen as a reminder you that you\u2019re potentially hiding people around you (it won\u2019t show up in snapshots, don\u2019t worry \ud83d\ude0a). Login screen Most likely the very first thing you\u2019ll notice about R12.1 is that the login screen has gotten an overhaul. To the right side of the Catznip logo you\u2019ll see the parcel highlight slightly improved from previous; it cycles through all of that categories highlights every few seconds. It now has an the indicator providing a rough indication of how populated a location currently is (3 green people being the busiest down to 1 green person for >1 and a hollow orange for deserted). For instance: While it\u2019s easy to find places in Second Life, it\u2019s not always easy to find places to be social, so this will hopefully help in discovering new and fun places with people to interact with. Also new is the category selector on the right: You can hover your mouse over the categories to see what they are and clicking them will switch the carousel over to that specific category. Down at the bottom we have: \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d is primarily useful during beta runs when it shows a list of all the JIRAs that were fixed or added for that particular beta \u201cGrid Status\u201d : all recent posts on the LL grid status \u201cblog\u201d \u201cModem World\u201d : Inara\u2019s RSS feed to keep up to date on most things SL \u201cReddit\u201d : The most recent threads from the SL reddit community \u201c Seraphim \u201d : RSS feed for all the shopping addicts among us, clicking the location column will set your login location to that specific event. We\u2019d really love your opinion on the new login screen as well: the good >and< the bad! We\u2019ve tried to make it be an actual part of your SL experience and present a lot of the most useful information to you as well as be an aid with the eternal question of \u201cwhat to do in Second Life\u201d. Minor Features Texture previews CATZ-456 - Show a texture tooltip for inventory floaters that only contain a single texture [FIXED] CATZ-457 - Texture previews and inspectors load slowly If you\u2019ve used Catznip for a while, you\u2019ll most likely have noticed that when you hover over a texture in your inventory that you\u2019ll get a thumbnail preview of that texture . Similarly to opening a texture preview they could sometimes take a while to open if they weren\u2019t already in your texture cache. While not quite instant, the loading time of texture previews (whether as a tooltip or opening the full preview floater) should be noticeably faster in R12.1. Additionally, when hovering over a folder that contains a single texture you\u2019ll see a texture tooltip for that folder. For vendors that include the product picture with your purchase; or for those who meticulously take pictures of clothing items and/or outfits this gives a very quick and visual way to go through folders, without having to open and examine each. Chat CATZ-386 - Allow the user to control how much vertical screen space is taken up by nearby chat toasts CATZ-436 - Add preference options to control how long nearby chat toasts stay visible [FIXED] CATZ-435 - The collapsed nearby chat floater drifts down every time its visibility is toggled [FIXED] CATZ-434 - Clicking 'Chat' on the toolbar hides nearby toasts when the nearby chat floater is collapsed Under the main Me menu / Preferences and then the Chat tab you\u2019ll now find more options to control how much vertical screen space can be occupied by nearby chat toasts and how long they linger on the screen before starting to fade. For those that wonder: the width of nearby chat toasts is actually derived from the width of the nearby chat floater. If you make it smaller or wider while nearby chat is visible you\u2019ll see them resize on the spot to match. (There\u2019s a debug setting to set them to a fixed width but I wouldn\u2019t actually recommend doing that). Show in Inventory [FIXED] CATZ-309 - 'Show in Inventory' check on inventory offers doesn't open inventory [FIXED] CATZ-317 - \"Show in Inventory\" checkbox doesn't seem to work on the buy/pay floater [FIXED] CATZ-453 - Clicking 'Show' on an notecard offer doesn't open the preview floater [FIXED] CATZ-461 - Right-click inventory offer / Show Inventory Item yields an error [FIXED] CATZ-462 - Clicking on the inventory item SLurl doesn't preview the item Added 'Preview Item' to the inventory offer context menu Catznip added the \u201cShow in inventory\u201d options to inventory offers and purchase floaters a while back, but it still never felt like it was doing quite what what expected; mostly due to 3 debug settings of which 2 directly conflicted. That\u2019s been cleaned up and (hopefully) simplified. Inventory offers for an item that can be previewed (notecards/landmarks/textures) now offer to show the object rather than its location in inventory. Building CATZ-384 - Add select prev/next link buttons to the build floater CATZ-413 - Allow texture repeats larger than 100 When \u2018Edit Linked\u2019 is checked, you can use the next and previous buttons to cycle through the individual links of a link set. Avatar Fix menu CATZ-430 - Group avatar troubleshooting options together in a sub-menu for both self & others CATZ-431 - Option to restart (a.k.a. sync) an avatar 's animations (or the animations of all avatars) All context menu options that you might (frequently) use to resolve a problem with an avatar in some way are now bundled under a \u2018Fix Avatar\u2019 submenu. Rebake Texture (default LL option) Refresh Textures \u2013 Clear and redownload all textures on every attachment including (baked) body textures Refresh Attachments \u2013 If one of your attachments ends up ghosted (you see it but others don\u2019t) then this will fix it for both of you Sync Animations \u2013 Restarts the animation of every other avatar on the same object you\u2019re sitting on (or every other avatar playing the same animation as you are) Reset Skeleton (default LL option) Reset Skeleton & Animations (default LL option) Stop Animating Me (default LL option) Synchronizing animations was a long time request so I\u2019m happy to finally add it, however it might work a bit different to what you\u2019re used to on Firestorm. For instance: if you pick the option for an avatar then the animations that avatar is currently playing, along with animations of everyone sitting on the same object , will all be restarted. This should give a smoother fix of just the people you want rather than reset everyone around you. A global \u201cSync Animations\u201d option has been added under the Advanced menu , this restarts all active animations. Appearance CATZ-481 - Show current/unsaved changes on the wearable edit panel While editing your shape (or any wearable such as alpha, physics, shirt, etc\u2026) any change you make will be shown in bold with an asterisk behind the name. In addition, the category that parameter belongs to will show in bold with an asterisk as well. Dragging a slider back to its previous value will switch it back to an unchanged state so you can always tell, at a glance, what exactly you\u2019ve changed and what will happen when you press the \u2018Save\u2019 button. Windlight Quick-Prefs CATZ-414 - Add 'Reset Windlight' to the Troubleshooting tab CATZ-459 - Minor improvements to the WindLight quick preferences panel The Windlight quick preferences panel got a few minor changes: There\u2019s now a slider for both \u2018Scene Gamma\u2019 and \u2018East Angle\u2019 \u201cDay Cycle\u201d, \u201cFixed Sky\u201d and \u201cWater\u201d have a third button that directly opens the edit floater A \u201cReset Windlight\u201d button to go back to the default (the same button is also present on the Troubleshooting preferences tab) Wearing appearance panel CATZ-343 - Show the total/remaining attachment count on the Wearing panel CATZ-427 - Touch/Edit context menu options on the Wearing panel are missing for temporary attachments [FIXED] CATZ-421 - Can't detach a temporary attachment from the Appearance / Wearing / Temporary Attachment accordion The appearance wearing panel had a number of small bug fixes (see above) as well as the number of worn (and total available) attachments and quick count of temporary/experience attachments. Drag & Drop CATZ-411 - Drag & drop texture upload broken CATZ-415 - Show the image upload preview when drag-and-drop uploading a texture CATZ-416 - Enable drag-and-drop uploading of animations, sounds and mesh models Drag & drop uploading from Explorer has been in Catznip for a while and now supports all file types that can be uploaded in the viewer. Additionally, when dropping a single file the upload floater will appear so you adjust settings (or preview). Bugfixes This is a list of all the other bugfixes included in this release : CATZ-154 - Resizing 'resident info' pane of IM window should maintain 1:1 aspect ratio while scaling profile picture CATZ-236 - Crash reports don't include partial logs CATZ-375 - Limit the texture memory slider to 2Gb maximum CATZ-380 - Snoozing a group for an undefined time should use that group's specific snooze duration rather than the global default CATZ-382 - Group list on the profile floater is incomplete/cut off CATZ-383 - \"Received items\" folder isn't visible on user added inventory panels CATZ-401 - Inventory floater pops up when right-clicking in Appearance / Outfits CATZ-402 - Don't make a sender's name clickable on collapsed group notices CATZ-403 - 'Share' missing on inventory context menu CATZ-404 - CONTROL_LEFT/CONTROL_RIGHT isn't sent while focus is on a text control CATZ-409 - Increasing the RAM backed texture cache beyond 2Gb causes an overflow CATZ-412 - Don't stop the audio stream when crossing parcel borders (with the same stream URL) CATZ-418 - Username dropdown on the login screen doesn't remember the last logged in user CATZ-419 - Chat following a teleport /friends offer isn't (always) visible in the IM conversation CATZ-423 - Sculpt maps aren't being refreshed when using \"Texture Refresh\" CATZ-425 - Unable to derender items on a banned parcel CATZ-429 - \"Sit Down\" option on the avatar self menu disappears when flying CATZ-433 - 'Display name' label truncated on the profile floater CATZ-437 - Changing outfits doesn't update the \"worn\" suffix on the outfit folder in inventory CATZ-438 - Hitting ENTER on the login name field should start log-in CATZ-449 - Complexity is visible in the name tag of blocked/muted avatars CATZ-455 - Don't make people a multi-millionaire when their L$ balance was unavailable CATZ-458 - Teleport offer/request toasts can become 'stuck' on the screen CATZ-479 - Money balance, offline IMs/offers or early chat/RLV commands can get lost during login Crash reporter doesn't understand status 400 code(s) The spinner control's label baseline is offset from the baseline of the text editor Various text/label overlap/cut-off issues in Preferences Various text/label overlap/cut-off issues on the Quick Preferences panels Crash fixes CRASH-23 - Crash in writeToRecorders() on log out CRASH-24 - LLImageGL::createGLTexture() LLError RLVa v2.2 Please read RLVa_2.2_Release_Notes for the detailed RLVa release notes.","title":"Catznip R12.1"},{"location":"release_notes/r12_1/#catznip-r121","text":"","title":"Catznip R12.1"},{"location":"release_notes/r12_1/#optimizations","text":"A lot of work went into optimizing this Catznip release: neither Coffea or I have recent hardware which makes it important that additions don\u2019t negatively impact our own overall experience ( FPS , etc).

Highlights We\u2019ve had some really good feedback about the new release notes format for the past 2 release so I\u2019ll keep trying to highlight new (or changed) features with a little blurb attached \ud83d\ude0a. Quick preferences The \u2018Worn Items\u2019 and \u2018Quick Inventory\u2019 panels on the \u2018Quick Prefs\u2019 floater were introduced in R12 and have been a big hit. R12.2 just adds some more improvements to them: CATZ-475 - Add button to open wearing panel to the 'Worn Items' quickprefs panel Clicking the shirt icon on the \u2018Worn Items\u2019 quick prefs panel will open its larger brother. CATZ-476 - Add button to open the selected folder to the 'Quick Access' quickprefs panel Similarly, the new inventory icon on the \u2018Quick Inventory\u2019 panel will open your inventory with that folder selected and opened. Show in Inventory CATZ-501 - Add 'Show in Inventory' to the worn attachment context menu An \u2018OMG how did we not think of this ourselves?!\u2019 request by a user adds a highly useful menu item to the right-click menu of any attachment : Clicking the menu item will open your inventory with the attachment \u2019s inventory item visible and selected. Clear inventory filter on close CATZ-494 - Option to reset the inventory filter when closing the filter floater A user reported that it wasn\u2019t obvious to them that closing the inventory filter floater wouldn\u2019t reset / clean up the filter options on that floater so I added an option to do just that in case other people are similarly confused. With the option checked, closing the floater will have the same effect as clicking the \u2018Reset Filters\u2019 button. Hover name tag offset Another user request of a simple feature: by default the sliders is all the way to the left. Dragging it to the right will increase the distance between the name tag and the avatar . \u2018Collapse All Folders\u2019 vs \u2018Collapse To Folders\u2019 CATZ-491 - Added \"Collapse To Folders\" option on the inventory gear menu to close all currently visible folders containing items The \u2018collapse\u2019 button has been there for a long time now on the inventory toolbar and resets your current inventory view to just showing only the top-level folders.

It's definitely been a very long road to get to this point but we've finally broken the curse and R13 is here in time for the new year! If you're reading this you'll notice we have a brand new release notes page and we've been working behind the scenes for many other improvements to streamline releases. We're getting close to being able to bring you much faster updates and new features than we've been delivering over the past year and you'll hear more about that very soon (keep an eye out on group notices!). Mac version Thanks to a hardware donation (you know who you are! \u2661) we have a working Mac again to test and develop on! The beta feedback has been largely positive but new Mac users should expect some rough edges; please do let us know about any problems you run into through the \"Feedback\" button at the top of the screen (next to your L$ balance). We already know we have the best installer out of all Second Life viewers, obviously... Camera presets The viewer has had the ability to let you change between 3 fixed camera presets for a while now; or even to set a custom camera viewpoint for those who wanted to delve into the debug settings. With the camera presets feature Linden Lab made it all a lot more accessible to everyone, even if it did come with quite horrible UI (it doubled in width \u2013 see below). From experience we know that people prefer a very minimal camera floater, so I did my best to keep things as tight as possible while still making the new feature easily accessible to everyone. You can read more about the feature and how to use it in Inara\u2019s tutorial @ https://modemworld.me/2020/05/19/tutorial-viewer-camera-presets/ . Do keep in mind she is referencing the official viewer\u2019s user interface, but everything should be clear enough to find your way around in Catznip if you keep on reading below \ud83d\ude0a. In integrating the feature we also came up with a few innovations of our own. For instance, you might have noticed there are now two sliders in between the orbit and pan controls: The left slider controls the camera zoom as it previously did (=using the scroll wheel on your mouse). When focused on an object we\u2019ve also slightly tweaked the slider values so you\u2019ll have more control when the camera is closer to the object rather than instantly fly off into the distance. The right slider controls the field of view (= Ctrl-8 / Ctrl-0) which is more commonly used to \u2018zoom\u2019 in tight to an attachment for editing. Additionally, both will now snap back to their default when resetting the camera (by hitting Esc). If you do want a different FoV you can change the default and then save your camera preset (see below) and it will always snap back to your desired value on reset. The dropdown lets you choose from your available presets and we have included the popular Penny Patton ones in the viewer by default. Pressing the gear icon will open the presets floater which is significantly different from the official viewer\u2019s (which confusingly has 3 separate floaters to do the same thing). On the left side you will see all presets. Clicking one will show you its detailed values on the right. The \u2018Refresh\u2019 icon will only show on presets that are included in the viewer by default and allow you reset them back in case you\u2019ve made changes to them that you\u2019re not at all happy with. To create a new preset, simply click the New button at the bottom right. To save your changes click Save; or click the down arrow to save your current values as an entirely new (custom) preset. You can immediately jump into changing the values; however you also have the option to pick \u2018Sync with camera\u2019 and move your camera into a rough starting position. Then uncheck the option when you have positioned it where you want it and tweak the values slightly to your liking before saving. To delete one of your own custom presets, hover over it on the left side and click the trash icon that appears. Finally: remember that Catznip has a transparency slider specifically for the Camera and Move floaters at the Me menu / Preferences / Colors tab. If you are one of the people who always keeps (one of) those floaters on screen, setting a low opacity will leave it accessible but not obscure part of the world. EEP / Windlight improvements Quick Preferences The panel went through a complete redesign and we would really love your feedback on it (especially if there's something you want quick access to that we forgot!) 'Use Shared Environment' is the same as the World / Environment / Use Shared Environment menu option. 'Personal Lighting...' will open the personal lighting floater (which we haven't changed - yet). The \u276e [left] and \u276f [right] buttons cycles you through the available options The wrench button immediately opens the 'Edit Environment' floater allowing you to make one-time changes or to save (a copy of) your changes. 'Reapply current Windlight at logon' is the same as before and will keep your Windlight settings consistent across relogs when checked. When unchecked you will always default to the 'shared' environment. 'Interpolate preset changes' will transition you from one setting to the next over 5 seconds when checked; or will change instantly between settings when unchecked. Since Windlight settings can now be present in your own inventory as well as the default library settings we've made it clearer in the dropdowns to see where a setting your picking is located in your inventory Active (Windlight) setting indicator When a Windlight (day/sky/water) setting is currently active you'll now see an 'active' indicator behind it in My Environments and the inventory floater. Edit library assets Normally, if you want to make small changes to a stock/library Windlight setting you'd first have to copy that item into your own inventory and then open it to make edits. This quality of life improvement allows you to open Windlight settings straight from the library (right-click inventory / Open) and then make your changes. When it's time to save, click the 'Save As' button which will save the new environment in your 'Settings' folder. (Remember that you can also pick 'Apply Only To Myself' to make temporary one-time changes without needing to clutter your inventory with unnecessary settings items). Floater cleanup Most of the Windlight floaters were cleaned up to make them take up less of your screen without feeling too cramped. Improvements Beacons I have added an option to control the height of the beacons which is particularly useful if you are trying to find the one scripted object in a sea of red lines that stretch to infinity. Using a height value of 4 for instance will give you a lot more spatial detail on where each beacon is located and marks tracking down an object so much easier. I have also added an option specifically to highlight light sources which can be useful if you\u2019re trying to set up a picture or any situation where you might have an unwanted light source that isn\u2019t immediately obvious. Group notice CATZ-530 - Show 'remaining characters' on the group notice floater Places search Pressing \u23ce [enter] on the text editor will run the search Pressing \u2b07 [down] afterwards will jump to the first result (where you can then use the arrow keys to navigate between them) Pressing \u23ce [enter] on a search result will teleport you to that location Clicking the search button manually will also set focus to the first result Double-clicking a search result will teleport you to that location Resolution scale If you're really struggling with your FPS then you can give the new resolution scale slider a try (it's under Me / Preferences / Graphics / Advanced). At 100% (all the way to the right) everything looks at normal; at 50% (all the way to the left) the viewer will render at half the normal resolution leaving you with a blockier view but hopefully a more manageable FPS (or allow you to enable Windlight / ALM where you otherwise couldn't). Play around with the setting - we've found there's definitely a sweet spot but it's different for each specific computer configuration. Minor improvements CATZ-547 - Option to turn off extra lighting that is applied when editing appearance CATZ-557 - Improve initial opening time for the landmarks floater (+ improved filtering performance) CATZ-584 - Give visual feedback when using an invalid regex for an inventory search CATZ-593 - Add option to sort Nearby and Friends list by username (cause nagging pony) CATZ-594 - Opening the feedback floater should give focus to the feedback form CATZ-597 : Add link to Discord server and clean up social media links CATZ-601 - Increase default and minimal texture cache size Add a button to open the 'Camera Presets' to preferences and remove the settings that are now part of the presets floater (namely camera focus offset and field of vision) Increase the maximum allowable texture memory limit from 33% to 50% of total Show the default value on slider controls (no snap to default but rather it's a bit 'sticky' once reached) Embed a no manifest copy of the viewer executable in the installer to cater to legacy Intel video cards with drives that won't run on Win10 Bugfixes CATZ-222 - Restoring a derendered object does not immediately make it visible again (it required a teleport away and back) CATZ-274 - Unchecking 'Turn Towards Selection' still turns the avatar towards a selected object CATZ-321 - Toggling \"Arm Points Towards Selection\" does update your avatar if you currently have an object selected Reminder: you can toggle this and \u2018Turn Towards Selection\u2019 from the Build / Options submenu (or by clicking the arrow next to \u2018Selection Options\u2019 when the builder floater is open).

It's definitely been a very long road to get to this point but we've finally broken the curse and R13 is here in time for the new year! If you're reading this you'll notice we have a brand new release notes page and we've been working behind the scenes for many other improvements to streamline releases. We're getting close to being able to bring you much faster updates and new features than we've been delivering over the past year and you'll hear more about that very soon (keep an eye out on group notices!).","title":"Catznip R13"},{"location":"release_notes/r13/#mac-version","text":"Thanks to a hardware donation (you know who you are! \u2661) we have a working Mac again to test and develop on!

We already know we have the best installer out of all Second Life viewers, obviously...","title":"Mac version"},{"location":"release_notes/r13/#camera-presets","text":"The viewer has had the ability to let you change between 3 fixed camera presets for a while now; or even to set a custom camera viewpoint for those who wanted to delve into the debug settings. With the camera presets feature Linden Lab made it all a lot more accessible to everyone, even if it did come with quite horrible UI (it doubled in width \u2013 see below). From experience we know that people prefer a very minimal camera floater, so I did my best to keep things as tight as possible while still making the new feature easily accessible to everyone. You can read more about the feature and how to use it in Inara\u2019s tutorial @ https://modemworld.me/2020/05/19/tutorial-viewer-camera-presets/ . Do keep in mind she is referencing the official viewer\u2019s user interface, but everything should be clear enough to find your way around in Catznip if you keep on reading below \ud83d\ude0a. In integrating the feature we also came up with a few innovations of our own. For instance, you might have noticed there are now two sliders in between the orbit and pan controls: The left slider controls the camera zoom as it previously did (=using the scroll wheel on your mouse). When focused on an object we\u2019ve also slightly tweaked the slider values so you\u2019ll have more control when the camera is closer to the object rather than instantly fly off into the distance. The right slider controls the field of view (= Ctrl-8 / Ctrl-0) which is more commonly used to \u2018zoom\u2019 in tight to an attachment for editing. Additionally, both will now snap back to their default when resetting the camera (by hitting Esc). If you do want a different FoV you can change the default and then save your camera preset (see below) and it will always snap back to your desired value on reset. The dropdown lets you choose from your available presets and we have included the popular Penny Patton ones in the viewer by default. Pressing the gear icon will open the presets floater which is significantly different from the official viewer\u2019s (which confusingly has 3 separate floaters to do the same thing). On the left side you will see all presets. Clicking one will show you its detailed values on the right. The \u2018Refresh\u2019 icon will only show on presets that are included in the viewer by default and allow you reset them back in case you\u2019ve made changes to them that you\u2019re not at all happy with. To create a new preset, simply click the New button at the bottom right. To save your changes click Save; or click the down arrow to save your current values as an entirely new (custom) preset. You can immediately jump into changing the values; however you also have the option to pick \u2018Sync with camera\u2019 and move your camera into a rough starting position. Then uncheck the option when you have positioned it where you want it and tweak the values slightly to your liking before saving. To delete one of your own custom presets, hover over it on the left side and click the trash icon that appears. Finally: remember that Catznip has a transparency slider specifically for the Camera and Move floaters at the Me menu / Preferences / Colors tab. If you are one of the people who always keeps (one of) those floaters on screen, setting a low opacity will leave it accessible but not obscure part of the world.","title":"Camera presets"},{"location":"release_notes/r13/#eep-windlight-improvements","text":"","title":"EEP / Windlight improvements"},{"location":"release_notes/r13/#quick-preferences","text":"The panel went through a complete redesign and we would really love your feedback on it (especially if there's something you want quick access to that we forgot!)
